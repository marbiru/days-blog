# Days, by the Kinks

Ah, the Kinks–– overshadowed (like almost everybody) by the unbeatable beats of the Beatles, they still managed to win a few bouts with those famous Merseybeatniks. The subversive Lola, the mocking Sunny Afternoon, the sincere Waterloo Sunset, will all echo endlessly in the minds and smiles of the listening public.

And then, up on the dais, the dazzling Days. “Thank you for the Days,” croon the Kinks, “those endless days those sacred days you gave me.” The days are not endless, they just feel endless. Too short, but eternal. “And though you’re gone, you’re with me every single day believe me.” Such are the struggles of the days, the nights, the years. And we know that before we begin. “You took my life, but then I knew that very soon you’d leave me.”

Either the Kinks have implausibly long memories or they’re not entirely truthful about the sad erosion that time plays on memory, as well as on time itself. “I won’t forget a single day believe me,” they sing, but we know that’s not true: some days leave their mark on our memories as long as we live, but other days disappear like sand castles on the beach. It can’t be helped: life is short and craft is long, opportunity is fleeting and experimentations perilous, judgment is difficult. Such is our lot, those of us who have drawn the long-short straw of existence. It’s a riddle as old as time itself, as old as humanity, as old as you and I.

And yet: we thank you for the days, whoever you are. Thank you for the days that we have grown into, the days that have made us into ourselves.
